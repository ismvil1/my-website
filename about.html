            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! I'm Ismail Choudhry, a 21-year-old rising senior at the City College of New York. With a strong passion for technology, I am eagerly looking to enter the tech world. My academic journey has equipped me with a solid foundation in computer science, and I have gained valuable experience through various projects.</p>
            <p>Throughout my time at City College, I have worked on numerous projects related to software engineering, which have honed my skills in coding, problem-solving, and project management. Additionally, my experience working in DevOps has provided me with a comprehensive understanding of software development life cycles and infrastructure management.</p>
            <p>Beyond my technical skills, I am deeply interested in understanding how technology can solve real-world problems and improve people's lives. I have always been fascinated by the potential of cloud computing, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence, and I am continuously learning and exploring these fields.</p>
            <p>In addition to my academic and professional pursuits, I enjoy staying updated with the latest technological advancements and continuously expanding my knowledge base. I actively participate in tech communities and attend industry conferences to network with professionals and stay informed about emerging trends.</p>
            <p>Outside of the tech world, I enjoy spending time with family and friends, exploring new places, and engaging in outdoor activities. I believe in maintaining a balanced lifestyle that includes physical fitness and mental well-being.</p>
            <p>As I near the completion of my degree, I am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead and am determined to make a meaningful impact in the tech industry.
